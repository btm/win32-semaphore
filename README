== Brief Description
   An interface for MS Windows Semaphores.

== Prerequisites
   win32-ipc 0.6.0 or later.

== Installation
   gem install win32-semaphore

== Synopsis
   require 'win32/semaphore'
   include Win32

   Semaphore.new(1, 5, 'test') do |sem|
     puts 'uh, oh' unless sem.wait(10) > 0
     sem.release(2) # 2
   end

== Documentation
   The semaphore.rb file contains inline RDoc documentation. If you installed
   this file as a gem, then you have the docs.

   For more detailed documentation about Semaphores on MS Windows in general,
   please visit http://www.msdn.com/library and lookup the CreateSemaphore(),
   OpenSemaphore() and ReleaseSemaphore() functions.

== Notes
   The Semaphore class is a subclass of Win32::Ipc (win32-ipc). This package
   require's the win32-ipc package internally (you don't need to explicitly
   call it).
